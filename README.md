# DANA - Vàlencia

From the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (https://www.icman.csic.es/) we have created this repository to host the RGB and water quality images such as chlorophyll-a and turbidity from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8/9 satellites before and after the DANA occurred in València on October 29, 2024.

The images closest to the DANA (30 by Landsat-8/9 and 31 by Sentinel-2) can be seen in http://eo.csic.es/marine-observatory/13-marine-observatory/104-valencia
